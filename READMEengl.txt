== Description ==

<h4>Official Website</h4>

You can find more information on our web site (<a href="https://asamblea.co/plugin-para-wordpress/">https://asamblea.co/plugin-para-wordpress/</a>)

This plugin allows you to manage meetings where you need users to vote and have a detailed online quorum count (Users that are online) to validate the votes. 

There are dozens of plugins that you can use to conduct polls, but none has the option to allow that users may have different weights and assign votes from one user to another one, under what is called a PROXY. So that when the user tha receives the proxy votes, his votes weighs for his own shares plus the shares of the user that provides the proxy. 


<h4>Features</h4>

1. Quorum page where you can show lists of online and offline users.
2. 2 type of polls: One answer and multiple answers. 
3. Show results to users with one click.
4. Open and close polls at any time with one click.
5. Export poll results to CSV files selecting the columns that you want.
6. Integrate with Zoom to have in a single page a Zoom meeting and the vote button.
